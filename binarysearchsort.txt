Prompts:
#1) please provide steps in binary sort & binary search and further write steps for each research methods
#2) Please create a flowchart representing the steps for carrying out  binary sort & binary search, incorporating the above steps. Ensure that related steps are placed side by side.
#3) Please write Mermaid code for this

//copy mermaid code and paste in draw.io
create file 
check add symbol and go to advance click mermaid 
paste the mermaid code from chatgpt subgraph Binary_Search
